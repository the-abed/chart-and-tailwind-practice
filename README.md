The main objective of this project is to **learn data visualization in React** and gain hands-on experience with:

## About Learning Pie Charts

Recently, I added a **Pie chart** to this project, which was a fun and exciting part of the learning process ðŸŽ¨.  
Pie charts helped me understand how to:

- Represent proportions visually  
- Use `ResponsiveContainer` for auto-resizing  
- Add tooltips and labels for better interactivity  
- Customize slice colors and legends  

This addition made learning charts even more engaging and enjoyable!
